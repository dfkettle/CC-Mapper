# CC-Mapper
Utility written in Pure Data to remap MIDI CC messages.

No external libraries are required, except those installed by default with Pure Data.

Only handles MIDI CC messages; all other messages (note on/off, pitch-bend, after-touch, etc.) are ignored.

As well as letting you remap CC numbers, it also allows you to specify input and output channels. You can also save and load presets you've created.
